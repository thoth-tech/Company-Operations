### E. Splash Kit

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives :-

Splashkit is a simple-to-use programming framework specialising in 2D games to help teach students
introductory programming through the development of games. The framework is primarily coded in C++
but can be used for C++, C#, Python, and Pascal.

#### Projects :-

- **Arcade Machines:** The university has purchased four Arcade machines that can be used to
  showcase games built-in SplashKit. The units run on a Rasberry Pi 3B+. Giving constraints and a
  target platform development. Our goal is to have this platform ready for students to show games
  developed using SplashKit by the Thoth Tech Splashkit team. In the long term, the aim is to have
  this platform available for first-year students with an easy-to-use process to upload their and
  test their games.

- **Tutorials:** As Splashkit is not a mainstream framework, there are fewer examples on how to use
  it effectively available online. Our aim is to create a small series of tutorials using game
  construction as the medium to convey how to use various SplashKit functions together.

- **SplashKit Expansion:** Splashkit framework was derived from a project called Swingame; in the
  original port, not all functions were moved across. The team will develop a roadmap reviewing what
  functions can be ported across and investigate new functions that can be added.

- **SplashKit Online:** A new project we wish to launch is SplashKit Online; the concept is to give
  students access to an IDE in a web browser and the ability to run their code in a web browser.

#### Aims for Trimester:-

1. This trimester's primary goal is to prepare the arcade machines for the Burwood open day,
   displaying students' work with playable demos.

2. Create at least two tutorials, showing how to use sprites and object interaction effectively.
   These areas will likely also be covered in the process of building an interactive game – Handel
   Inputs, Draw to window, Animations, Collision detection.

3. The team will review what functions can be ported, develop a roadmap create processes for
   contributing to Splashkit Framework, and investigate & manage bug reports.

4. Investigate and produce initial designs for how SplashKit Online can work.

## Product: Art Gallery Indigenous Art Gallery

Description of Progress: Project is on hold.

### Change to Plan

Our goals have changed from 2.1P as we are no longer planning to deploy the product this trimester.
We are instead focusing on developing a robust deployment strategy as well as a set of guidelines
for future cohorts to deploy our product effectively. We are also continuing to focus on enhancing
the front and back ends of our product in line with suggestions made by our client.

### Deployment

Description of Progress

We have completed documentation on different types of deployment strategies and selected GCP and
GitHub Actions as our preferred tools. Additionally, we have completed the preliminary proposal for
using GCP to deploy the application, and the cybersecurity steps needed to ensure all collaborators
use GCP safely and securely. We are currently researching GitHub Actions for CI/CD development and
different checks to be used by the team. The paperwork required for us to be granted permission to
use GCP as our deployment platform has been prepared and submitted by Chloe, and we are currently
waiting to hear back.

### Change to the Plan :--

After completing research on different types of deployment Ayan was assigned to research more of
these strategies. After liaising with stakeholders, we selected GCP as our preferred tool, and so we
halted our continued research into other deployment strategies. Ayan was then required to make a
proposal and cybersecurity policy for the team to be granted access to GCP. Ayan initially ran into
some issues with Prettier when submitting documents to our repo, so Chloe submitted his work on his
behalf - please note he must be credited with this
[PR](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/pull/317).

### Backend Enhancements

Description of Progress

The backend enhancements project within the Indigenous Art Gallery product has made several strides
within the first half of the trimester. Namely, the API has been migrated to .NET 8.1, and the
Docker containers have been rebuilt for this change to come into effect. Documentation relating to
these changes has been modified to mention the change (README files). Additionally, a preliminary
proposal was put forward prior to the migration, which discusses the breaking changes we can expect
to look out for, as well as recommending

enhancements available to us in .NET 8. An additional proposal has been put forward documenting the
benefits of implementing asynchrony in our API. It also includes an action plan for implementing
asynchrony in our RP implementation in our API, which will be completed over the remainder of the
trimester.

### Changes to the overall Plan:--

Where the backend enhancements project deviated from the initial plan was by creating a Postman
workspace for the team to use. This is helpful in streamlining the testing of our API, as well as
automating some of our testing. So far, 33 automated tests have been created to validate the
behavior of the API. This was due to be created at the end of the trimester, but we decided it would
be more beneficial to create this upfront, to facilitate the testing of our asynchrony
implementation. A README style file has been created as guidelines on how the company should proceed
with using this platform.

### IIIF

Description of Progress

So far, we have been able to research what IIIF is and what it is capable of achieving and if it is
beneficial for the Art Gallery. Dominic has also completed a basic course on what IIIF is in more
technical aspect as well as how to convert an image into a IIIF format for viewing on a universal
viewer. For the rest of the trimester, Dominic will be implementing the IIIF into the Art Gallery
Project.

#### Change to Plan:-

No changes have been made to the plan. Dominic is continuing to work on implementing IIIF, after
having up-skilled by completing a course, and having produced research documentation in the first
sprint.

### Lighthouse Implementations

Description of Progress

We have done a full review of the lighthouse project from the previous trimester and set up an
action plan for components to be implemented from the report. Currently, Sivasamyuktha

is upskilling in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the use of Git. For the duration of the trimester, we
will be working on JavaScript and website-related tasks to help improve Lighthouse scores.

#### Changes to the \_Plan:-

No changes at this stage.

##### Frontend Enhancements

Description of Progress

The front-end team have redesigned our logo, as well as having sorted through the code base to
determine which areas need to be upgraded (pure HTML to Vue components). They have created a backlog
of these changes and began to implement them.

#### Changes \_to the Plan

No changes at this stage.

## Product: Courseflow

### Frontend – Unit discovery page

Description of Progress

- We now have working prototypes demonstrating the key features of the webpage that allows users to
  find information about related units easily by displaying them as a network using the d3js
  library.

- Unit data is currently sourced from data extracted from Deakin’s 2019 handbook PDFs.

#### Changes to\_ the Plan

No significant changes to the original plan.

### Frontend – 2 Factor Authentication

Description of Progress

Figma design on the 2FA web page, aligning navigation bar and others to another front-end project to
stay consistent. At the same time developing the webpage based on the design using TypeScript as a
part of coding language.

#### Changes to the Plan\_:-

Future changes maybe design wise, and further impact on the code/html webpage.

### Frontend – Coursemap UI redesign

Description of Progress

Development with Angular underway:

- Various components for the front-end have been developed.

- Components have been developed so that will load information dynamically if they are fed relevant
  JSON data.

Redesign largely finished:

- The UI redesign has been largely finished. Various iterations have been complete and the final
  result is much more intuitive than the initial design.

- Final segment to be complete is the exact navigation for a side menu, however the current planned
  design is in development.

Unit and course data has been obtained:

- A JSON file with information for various courses as well as units has been obtained. This can be
  used alongside the previous data scraped JSON files.

- This has been split into sub files relevant to specific courses. Therefore, only the required JSON
  file needs to be accessed for a course.

#### Changes to the Plan\_\_:-

- More time than expected was spent on the redesign process

- New team members have taken longer than expected to upskill on Angular, this has limited the
  number of members that have been able to work on technical contributions.

- The exact MVP for the end of the trimester has been refined to displaying information related to
  the 2023 ‘Bachelor of Computer Science’

### General/documentation

Description of Progress

- RESTful API endpoints have been defined and implemented.

- Received unit and course data from a course director. Further analysis of the data received will
  be required to determine how to best use them.

- Early research into Dockerisation of the dev environment is complete. WIP container for front-end
  environment is complete. In the future we will need to add the development environment for the
  backend as well to the container.

- Trello board integration with GitHub added

- GitHub Contribution.md and README.md files created

#### Changes to the original Plan

No significant changes to the original plan.
